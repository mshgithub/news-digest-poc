# news-digest-poc
A proof-of-concept application that demonstrates using Playwright and an LLM to create a custom digest of state legislation from user-submitted keywords.

## LLM Help
I'm using a lot of LLM conversations to build this proof-of-concept. You can review them here:

- [Playwright script extraction](https://chatgpt.com/share/689bb599-f0b4-8013-81a9-96b3421bdb87) - this is a second attempt. I decided to start over and see how far I could go in one stream of consciousness conversation over 30 minutes while I lay in bed playing on my phone. I didn't do a good job of setting up the whole vision from the outset, so a lot of the code can't be used without significant modifications, but the overall ideas are great.
